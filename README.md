# Electronic Health Certificate Verification App Android

Scan a QR Code from <https://dev.a-sit.at/certservice> and verify the contents of the HCERT structure.

Note: Other contents can not be verified, since the certificate is loaded from <https://dev.a-sit.at/certservice> for now.

A prebuilt version of this App is published at <https://dev.a-sit.at/android/app-debug.apk> and can be installed on any Android device running Android 7.0 or later.
